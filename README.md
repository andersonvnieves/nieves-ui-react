EVODS (Evolving Design System) is an UI design system created to help speed up the start of new projects by providing a basic set of reusable components and styles.
EVODS offers a ready-made foundation to get projects off the ground faster.

## Background and Purpose

EVODS was born out of the Mangos project, where an intentional constraint was set: avoid using existing UI libraries and components to turn the work into a hands‑on learning opportunity.
That constraint led to designing, prototyping, and refining a set of primitives and patterns, revealing the value of consolidating them into a cohesive system.

## Non‑commercial notice

EVODS is an independent, non‑commercial project created for study, experimentation, and personal productivity.
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially supported by any company or client.
Use it at your own discretion and evaluate fitness for your specific use case.

## What to Expect

- A collection of essential UI components with consistent styling.
- Basic design tokens like colors and typography to unify appearance.
- Practical, straightforward documentation to guide usage.

## What’s not in scope (yet)

- Extensive component coverage, edge‑case theming, and heavy customization layers.
- Cross‑framework ports. Initial focus is React with room to evolve later.
- Formal support commitments. Issues and improvements are addressed as time allows.

## Acknowledgements
